    2. **Years of Experience:** {years_of_experience}

    For {experience_level} candidates:
    - Ask questions that focus on {question_focus}
    - Include questions that test {question_types}

    Ensure the questions are relevant and reflect the candidateâ€™s experience level and the role they are applying for.
    Also make sure to only frame one question at one time.
